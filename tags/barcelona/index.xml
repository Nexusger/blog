      <description>Our third day in Barcelona started with Bauernfrühstück. We had some cooked potatoes left and added some eggs, bacon and onions for a delicious meal. After the breakfast we headed for the parc de la ciutadella saw the font de la cascada, an imposant monument with (you would never guess) some cascading wells.

The park is nice, mostly populated by joggers, school classes and mammoths. The three buildings which were marked in our map were all unsatisfying.</description>

      <description>The second day of our holiday started relaxed: We slept till 11 AM and had a long breakfast with cereals and toast. Interestingly enough the milk you can buy here in the supermarket gets sold uncooled. This seemed a littel bit odd to me, because in Germany almost all milk is getting sold cooled. The only milk in Germany you can buy uncooled is UHT-milk. So I assume the milk is kinda prepared as well.</description>

      <description>Today my fiancée and I flew to Barcelona, for our vacation. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit early in the year for a hot Spain holiday, but the city is big enough to cover some bad-weather days.
We flew with germanwings from Berlin at 11 AM and had a pleasantly easy flight. My fiancée and I played Ticket to Ride on her iPad (two times, we had a tie). By the way, Ticket to Ride is a nice game you should absolutly try it once (Amazon Affiliate Link)In Barcelona we took the Aerobus Barcelona to the plaça del catalunya and walked the last part to our AirBnB accommodation.</description>
