      <description>Woe unto me! Earlier this day I debugged a korn shell script and were not able to find the culprit. With debugging mode

I had inserted an unnecessary space between the variable name and the equal-sign. Therefore the interpreter didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what I wanted him to do.</description>
