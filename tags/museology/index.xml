      <description>Whoohaaa a new project from the university. David and I were assigned to the Computer Museum on the university campus. There we (and six other students) will be responsible to install, customize and deploy a tool called CollectiveAccess (Homepage). CA is a open source tool to register items, tag and mark them and then display them on a front end.
There were two teams of the terms before us, who already made some analysis,Â set up server and even made some sleek videos of some of the items.</description>
