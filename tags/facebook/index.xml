      <description>Problem: Setting up a wireless adapter on Ubuntu server 12.04 LTS via CLI isn&amp;rsquo;t THAT easy. Plug&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;Play doesn&amp;rsquo;t simply work. Good thing there is Google. And a lot of helpful sites.
Target: Insert the stick (or boot with it) and connect automaticly to the preferred network
This is not a tutorial. And it&amp;rsquo;s realy not for the uninitiated. It&amp;rsquo;s more like a short reminder for me, or people who have a basic idea what&amp;rsquo;s happening here&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Kick Ass - Comic vs. Movie</title>

      <description>Whoohoo I loved Kick Ass The movie, but now that I&amp;rsquo;ve read the underlaying comic, I think a little bit different about the movie. At least in the story there are major changes
The movie is, for it self, very entertaining. The cast of the movie was well done and consistent. I think the actors matched the characters and especialy that Hit Girl was a good cast. The soundtrackis entertaining and the track &amp;ldquo;stand up&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;the prodigy&amp;rdquo; is at least for me inseparably associated with this movie.</description>

      <title>New term, new pain</title>

      <description>A new term started today and so far nothing interesting happened. System management and analysis would be generally an interesting course, but till now it&amp;rsquo;s only a recapitulation of known facts, so everyone has the same level of knowledge.
The problem is: There are so many students here which seem to know everything, or at least think that they know everything. (Of course, only David knows everything). It&amp;rsquo;s interesting when they answer a mere rethorical question wrong and the lecturer tries to avoid to say: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s wrong&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Ever wanted to know how egg cartons would look like, if you stack up enough to contain 352 eggs?
Me neither. Nonetheless, here are the egg cartons we gathered for our band room:

We gathered so many of them to quieten our band room. But now (after we accumulated so many cartons) we canceled the room, because of a raise of the rent.</description>
