      <description>Whoohoo I loved Kick Ass The movie, but now that I&amp;rsquo;ve read the underlaying comic, I think a little bit different about the movie. At least in the story there are major changes
The movie is, for it self, very entertaining. The cast of the movie was well done and consistent. I think the actors matched the characters and especialy that Hit Girl was a good cast. The soundtrackis entertaining and the track &amp;ldquo;stand up&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;the prodigy&amp;rdquo; is at least for me inseparably associated with this movie.</description>
