      <description>Tl;dr: YNAB4 is awesome and you should give it a try. I managed my finances!
How the time flies by! A year ago I installed You Need A Budget 4 as trial on my system. Since then I used the software (or the Android version) everyday. After the trial period I asked the ynab.com for the free student version of their software. After the license key arrived everything worked fine.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the software You Need A Budget for my budgeting purposes. I was evaluating the software after I realized that my Excel solution is not feasible (read: to complicated).
I installed the 30 days trial version until it expired. After that I uninstalled it and used the Steam demo version. So I had double the evaluation time. And evaluate I did. After that time I was this close to actually purchase YNAB 4 via Steam.</description>
