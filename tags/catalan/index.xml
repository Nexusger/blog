      <description>Today my fiancée and I flew to Barcelona, for our vacation. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit early in the year for a hot Spain holiday, but the city is big enough to cover some bad-weather days.
We flew with germanwings from Berlin at 11 AM and had a pleasantly easy flight. My fiancée and I played Ticket to Ride on her iPad (two times, we had a tie). By the way, Ticket to Ride is a nice game you should absolutly try it once (Amazon Affiliate Link)In Barcelona we took the Aerobus Barcelona to the plaça del catalunya and walked the last part to our AirBnB accommodation.</description>
