      <description>This blog post is one part of the series “learning diary” for a course at my university.
Goal of this report is to take and rate a online learning unit. For the third learning unit we should take either a webinar or a MOOC. I participated in the course Design 1o1 Redux - Part 2: My House from the Iversity platform.
Short synopsis of the unit: The course “Design 1o1 Redux – Part 2: My House” was the second of three courses on the platform Iversity created by the Design 1o1 Community.</description>

      <description>This blog post is one part of the series &amp;ldquo;learning diary&amp;rdquo; for a course at my university.
Goals: Based on the title for that unit I assume we will learn something about designing MOOC. The linked article on the other hand, features a paper about the Tech Ed Revolution, which &amp;ldquo;will be the Learner Revolution&amp;rdquo;. It goes on and on about investors needing to put money in education (either traditional education or start ups) and how these start ups could fuel the next learning revolution.</description>
