      <description>Summary: My Dell XPS 13 9360 laptop has issues with the touchpad. The Dell support site is the pure horror but the Dell support team via Facebook is fast and helpful.
Long story: Several days ago the trackpad stopped working. It started when I connected a Apple Magic Mouse for more convenient playing. When I disconnected the mouse, I realized that the trackpad stopped working. Thinking the laptop just swallowed up I restarted the system.</description>

      <description>Lately I got interested in the programming language Elixir. I have not yet done anything besides the very first parts of the tutorial and the fantastic introduction from José Valim. It looks fun and very capable, even if I have to think around the corner (Elixir is functional and I&amp;rsquo;m more used to the object oriented programming paradigma)
After reading some parts of the tutorial on my daily commute to work, I was exited to start.</description>
