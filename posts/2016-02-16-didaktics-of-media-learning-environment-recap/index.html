<p>This will be the last article in this category, as the course nears its end. I will have a short recap on my experience in this course and how it changed my learning behavior. This is the logical follow up to my post <a href="/posts/2015-10-15-learning-environment-status-quo/">Learning Environment: Status Quo</a>.</p>

<h1 id="experience-in-this-course">Experience in this course</h1>

<p>This course differs from all my other courses because this is the first course I took outside my &ldquo;normal&rdquo; curriculum. So all fellow students had a different background than me, probably already knew the professor etc.</p>

<p>Yet the course was one of the best I had in University. I think I learned a lot in this course and had contact and insight to many topics which I probably would never had deemed worth investigating. Although the professor is strict and the workload is not deniable, I am happy I chose this course.</p>

<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>

<p>In the mentioned article I listed five methods I use when learning:</p>

<ol>
<li>Information consumption</li>
<li>Training</li>
<li>Discussion</li>
<li>Information curation</li>
<li>Reflection</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-information-consumption">1 - Information consumption</h2>

<p>I still rely heavily on my ability to consume and process an huge amount of information. So no changes here.</p>

<h2 id="2-training">2 - Training</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in the linked post, doing is better than listening. In the time of the course I hadn&rsquo;t had that much training (of any kind, not even my martial art). So I hesitate to write something about this part. The only thing I can think of is the third learning unit (<a href="/posts/2016-01-17-didaktics-of-media-learning-unit-three-report/">the MOOC</a>), where I had a lot of hands on work to do (see my result here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/torbenbrauer/">Instagram</a>)</p>

<h2 id="3-discussion">3 - Discussion</h2>

<p>As in the section before, not that much changed here: I went to some meetups and also had good high quality discussions with colleagues. But nothing drastically differed by participating the course.</p>

<h2 id="4-information-curation">4 - Information curation</h2>

<p>Not that much changed here as well: Only 26 upvotes on good questions or answers on Stackoverflow.com for example.</p>

<h2 id="5-reflection">5 - Reflection</h2>

<p>Of the five sections, the &ldquo;Reflection&rdquo; section is the one with the most changes, I would think. I wrote 17 posts for this course alone, that&rsquo;s more than for all other topics in that time span. It feels good to recapitulate the learned topics and to put whole sentences on the blog.</p>

<h1 id="tools">Tools</h1>

<p>The tools section changed as well. For example I reduced my amount of Feedly and Facebook to 30 minutes a day (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=de">StayFocusd</a> for Chrome). The other mentioned tools didn&rsquo;t change that much. I blogged a little bit more than usual (which is good) and used Stackoverflow and Evernote a bit less.</p>

<p>Something I did add to my toolbox (based on this course) is <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a>, a very good training site. I really recommend is warmly. Something I also use since the course is <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">DuoLingo</a>, mostly on my mobile phone. Currently I learn Swedish with DuoLingo and binge watch every thing actor model related on Plurasight.</p>
