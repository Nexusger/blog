<p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> YNAB4 is awesome and you should give it a try. I managed my finances!</p>

<p>How the time flies by! A year ago I installed <strong>You Need A Budget 4</strong>  as trial on my system. Since then I used the software (or the Android version) everyday. After the trial period I asked the <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">ynab.com</a> for the <a href="/posts/2014-06-04-you-need-a-budget-free-students-licence">free student version</a> of their software. After the license key arrived everything worked fine. No need to import/export data between trial and full product.</p>

<h1 id="so-what-can-i-say-after-using-ynab4-for-around-a-year">So, what can I say after using YNAB4 for around a year?</h1>

<h2 id="accounts-a-lot-of-them">Accounts - A lot of them</h2>

<p>I set up around ten different accounts in YNAB. Despite the fact that it sound as if I am a finance broker or something this seems like the ideal number of accounts for me:</p>

<ul>
<li> From my pre-YNAB time I have two checkings accounts with which I tried to seperate reoccuring payments and &ldquo;fun-money&rdquo;. This was a hassle to manage, because you had to bank-transfer money often.</li>
<li>Both checkings accounts came with one free debit card each. So yeah, I use one for Steam purchases and even that seldom. I set up the account in YNAB for the sake of completeness.</li>
<li>One of my most often used account is &ldquo;cash&rdquo;. For obvious reason (for non-Germans: Credit/debit card use is sparse in Germany. Bank-card or ca$h)</li>
<li>Also from my pre-YNAB time: A savings account. It was planned to save money there, but the interest rate of 0.1% is - how to put it&hellip; low</li>
<li>My student loan has its own account. Currently with a red number, bat soon to be changed :-)</li>
<li>I do have a box with lose coins. So I went out to count that and create another account for that ^^ Also I happen to have an box where I put my can deposit into.</li>
<li>After I set up my accounts and used YNAB a time I found the need for additional accounts: lent money.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lent-money-how-to-handle-money-which-isn-t-here">&ldquo;Lent Money&rdquo; - How to handle money which isn&rsquo;t here</h2>

<p>I lent a lot (read: often, not high sums) money to friends or my girlfriend, disburse the groceries purchase or, the other way around, someone pays for me because I left my wallet in the office. Because I tended to forget whom to pay what (and who to remind for some Euros) I set up the &ldquo;lent money&rdquo; account. When ever I lend money, I make a YNAB transfer to that account. This way I have  the same amount of money in total, but literary spoken in another mans pocket. The same goes for a splited meal with my girlfriend (split categories are great for that). If we pay thirty Euros I set the category to split. The one half goes to my Food category, the other half to the &ldquo;lent money&rdquo; account. Kind of special is my girlfriend, who has her own &ldquo;lent money girlfriend&rdquo; account. This way we can balance our lent money.</p>

<h2 id="renconcile-often">Renconcile often</h2>

<p>One thing I learned: Reconcile the account often. Especialy the cash account (because you don&rsquo;t have a balance/register like with credit cards). Personaly I try to reconcile every week, and even that is sometimes not enough.</p>

<h2 id="scheduled-transactions">Scheduled Transactions</h2>

<p>Usefull not only for the rent but for every reoccuring payment with fixed sum. Bonus for using the &ldquo;Total scheduled outflows this month&rdquo;-feature in the budget view.</p>

<h2 id="capture-the-flag">Capture the flag</h2>

<p>A feature I have not used once are flags. I honestly have no idea how to put them to good use. Maybe I miss a major feature, but right now I removed the column.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2015-04-09-ynab-one-year-review/flags.jpg" title="Flags - I do not use them"><img src="/images/2015-04-09-ynab-one-year-review/flags.jpg" alt="Flags - I do not use them" />
</a></p>

<h2 id="budget-view">Budget View</h2>

<p>Regarding the budget view I can just say that I do like it very granular. I have fourteen main categories, each with its according sub categories. I use the note feature a lot, for the budget categories as well as the &ldquo;budget category per month&rdquo; column.</p>

<p>From the provided autofill features I use only &ldquo;Amount budgeted last month&rdquo; and &ldquo;Average outflows for last 3 months&rdquo; regulary. The calculator is unfortunatly only ok: If I use keyboard only it&rsquo;s clever enough to pop up when I start to type an equotation (&ldquo;7 * 7&rdquo;) but does not recognize the multiply sign at the calculator itself. Instead it sums everything up.</p>
