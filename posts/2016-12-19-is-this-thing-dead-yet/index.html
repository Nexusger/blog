<p>I did it, I finished my masters in Informatics. After five and a half years I finally don&rsquo;t have to worry any more about exams and tasks for the university. A relieving feeling.</p>

<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h2>

<p>Looking back at the time in the university (<a href="https://htw-berlin.de">University of Applied Sciences Berlin</a>) I&rsquo;m happy that I took the challenge of starting to study. As I don&rsquo;t have the normally mandatory &ldquo;Abitur&rdquo; I was only able to study because auf my apprenticeship and work experience. This actually helped me a lot to put some of the content of the lessons into context. Also I think that my higher age (compared to my fellow students) helped me, to take the study more serious.</p>

<p>The curriculum of the University is in my opinion OK. In the bachelor one of the specialization I tried for one semester (facility management) was not useful at all but the updated curriculum already ditched this topic. What I recommend to add to the curriculum would be a tutoring about Version Control, Build Server and CI early in the study. If I remember correctly those topics never arose but were introduced to students by other students who worked in companies.</p>

<p>The Master curriculum was a bit more disappointingly. The master has a focus on research, which is reflected in 32 credit points out of 90 being research related (plus the master thesis which is also research related). This was somewhat cumbersome. I learned a lot in those topics but as it stands now I don&rsquo;t want to do research (see next section).</p>

<p>Additionally to learning about a lot of different topics, I met fantastic people over the course of the study and am glad to know them. I had a great time learning different topics and I realized I like to learn and switch topics often. Sometimes I wished I had more time at a specific topics but the next topic also were interesting. So much to learn so little time.</p>

<p>I also started to work besides the study at a company (<a href="http://big-social-media.com/">BIG Social Media GmbH</a>) where I learned a lot about C#, .Net, Node, Docker, CI and Version Control. I could use a lot of the ideas for my study (as well as the money obviously), so I recommend working besides the study. Also if you are in Berlin and looking for a job doing Bots, Node and JavaScript as well as C#: Have a look at there openings.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-be-next">What will be next?</h2>

<p>I have no idea what will be next. Currently I&rsquo;m on holiday, travelling the world or at least some parts of it. I&rsquo;m thinking hard about what I will do after that. I&rsquo;ll need money so I have to work. And this work will be something with informatics. But what it will be explicitly: I have no idea. Maybe working as a consultant or freelancer as this would enable me to have different projects often. Or starting my own business as I have plenty of ideas (some of them even are not completely useless!). Or I find the perfect company which fit to my needs.</p>

<p>At least for my own desire to learn I have gifted my self some ebooks from Manning (I had a 50% off coupon):</p>

<ul>
<li>Richard Feldman - Elm in Action (MEAP v3)</li>
<li>Enrico Buonanno - Functional Programming in C# (MEAP v6)</li>
<li>Dustin Metzgar - .NET Core in Action (MEAP v2)</li>
<li>Benjamin Tan Wei Hao - The little Elixir &amp; OTP Guidebook</li>
<li>Jim Bennet - Xamarin in Action (MEAP v3)</li>
</ul>

<p>As one can see functional programming (Elm in Action, Functional programming in C# and The little Elixir &amp; OTP Guidebook) are one topic of interest as well as .Net (Functional Programming in C#, .Net Core in Action and Xamarin in Action). After I finished these I will post a short review (at least about the MEAP Versions)</p>
