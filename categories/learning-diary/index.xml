Experience in this course This course differs from all my other courses because this is the first course I took outside my &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; curriculum.</description>

Goal of this report is to take and rate a online learning unit. For the fourth and final learning unit we should take a mobile learning unit.

      <description>This blog post is one part of the series &amp;ldquo;learning diary&amp;rdquo; for a course at my university.
Goals: Based on the title for that unit I assume we will learn something about storytelling in the context of didactic.
What have I learned: People remember stories. If information is wrapped up in a story, it increases the possibility that one remember the information as well.
A story consists of a setting, a plot, a character, a narrator with a point of view, (words, pictures, sounds) and most importantly listeners or readers.</description>

Short synopsis of the unit: The course “Design 1o1 Redux – Part 2: My House” was the second of three courses on the platform Iversity created by the Design 1o1 Community.</description>

      <description>This blog post is one part of the series &amp;ldquo;learning diary&amp;rdquo; for a course at my university.
Goals: Based on the title for that unit I assume we will learn something about designing MOOC. The linked article on the other hand, features a paper about the Tech Ed Revolution, which &amp;ldquo;will be the Learner Revolution&amp;rdquo;. It goes on and on about investors needing to put money in education (either traditional education or start ups) and how these start ups could fuel the next learning revolution.</description>

      <description>This blog post is one part of the series &amp;ldquo;learning diary&amp;rdquo; for a course at my university.
Goals: Based on the pdf which was provided I assume we will learn something about communities of learners. In the pdf it&amp;rsquo;s stated that the oldest definition for a university is &amp;ldquo;a community of learners and teachers&amp;rdquo;. So I assume we will learn more about the University as a community of teachers and learners.</description>

      <description>Today I attended the exhibition of the OEB in Berlin at the Intercontinental Hotel. I only visited the exhibition, which was free because the fee for the conference it self would have been to much to bear (roughly 480€). I visited some of exhibitors and will here summarize my experience.

      <description>This blog post is one part of the series &amp;ldquo;learning diary&amp;rdquo; for a course at my university.
Goals: Based on the title and the provided pdf for that unit I assume we will learn how to evaluate and compare different examination methods for different kinds of learning goals. I think we will consider target groups, the goal of the examination and several other aspects of online examination.
In the end I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to create my own online examination because we need to create multiple choice tests later on.</description>

      <description>This blog post is one part of the series &amp;ldquo;learning diary&amp;rdquo; for a course at my university.
Goals: Besides the headline &amp;ldquo;Didaktical-methodological Design&amp;rdquo; an additional hint to a book was provided &amp;ldquo;Schulmeister, Ralf, Hypermedia Learning Systems&amp;rdquo;. Because of that I investigated a little bit about hyper media learning systems. For example what hyper media learning system means&amp;hellip;
Turns out, hyper media is a word creation from hypertext and media. It describes systems where media content is linked to to other media content (in contrast to hypertext, where foot notes, citations and text is linked together).</description>

Also the planning of an online course seems to be involved. The four decisions to make if one would create a online course are:</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/posts/2015-10-15-learning-environment-status-quo/</guid>
      <description>In this article I provide a glance about my learning environment. This includes my methods (or my behavior) and the tools I use to learn and gather knowledge.
Methods I don&amp;rsquo;t have a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; method for learning. Most of the time I rely on my memory to remember &amp;ldquo;yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard/read about that and I have an idea how to find it again&amp;rdquo;. This works kind of good for me, as I&amp;rsquo;m living in a highly connected world and have the wisdom of the world at my fingertips.</description>
